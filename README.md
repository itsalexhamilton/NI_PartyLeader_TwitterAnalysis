# NI_PartyLeader_TwitterAnalysis

PROJECT AIM: A high level analysis of the twitter data of each of the elected political party leaders of Northern Ireland, as of May 2022.

**ðŸ“š Introduction**

In this project, I aimed to create a high level analysis of each of the seven political party leaders in Northern Ireland, mirroring a similar study referenced down below. The following questions were posed for this study:

1. Which Northern Irish political leader is the most active on the platform?
2. How does each Northern Irish political leader use their Twitter account? As a platform for press releases and statements or to connect with their consitutuency and Twitter following?
3. What are the most frequently mentioned keywords for each Political leader? How do these differ by designation and party affiliation?
4. Are certain party leader's more positive or negative in their sentiment?

In this repository, you can find the Excel files with the Twitter data for each of the seven leaders, the code used to manipulate each of these datasets which were finally uplaoded to a locally hosted PostgreSQL server for further manipulation and analysis.

I have also attached a text file with the basic information to get started for each leader incl
